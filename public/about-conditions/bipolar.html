<h1>About Bipolar Disorder</h1>

<p><strong>Bipolar disorder</strong> is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings between emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). These aren't just normal ups and downs - they're intense mood episodes that can last days, weeks, or months. During manic episodes, people feel unusually energetic, happy, or irritable. During depressive episodes, they feel very sad, hopeless, or empty. The condition affects about 1 in 100 people and usually starts in the late teens or early twenties.</p>

<h2>Common Symptoms</h2>

<p><strong>Manic episodes</strong> include feeling extremely happy or energetic, needing very little sleep, talking fast, having racing thoughts, being easily distracted, and making risky decisions. People might spend money they don't have, engage in risky behavior, or feel like they can do anything. <strong>Depressive episodes</strong> include feeling very sad or empty, losing interest in activities, sleeping too much or too little, feeling worthless or guilty, having trouble concentrating, and sometimes thinking about death or suicide.</p>

<h2>How It's Treated</h2>

<p>Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, but it's very manageable with proper treatment. <strong>Mood stabilizing medications</strong> like lithium or anticonvulsants help prevent mood episodes. <strong>Therapy</strong> such as cognitive behavioral therapy or family therapy helps people learn to manage symptoms and maintain relationships. <strong>Lifestyle management</strong> including regular sleep schedules, stress reduction, and avoiding alcohol and drugs is crucial. Many people also benefit from support groups where they can connect with others who understand their experiences.</p>

<h2>What to Do Next</h2>

<p>If you think you might have bipolar disorder, it's important to see a mental health professional for proper evaluation. Bipolar disorder can be confused with other conditions, so getting an accurate diagnosis is key to effective treatment. With proper care, people with bipolar disorder can live stable, productive lives. Many successful people have bipolar disorder and manage it well with treatment. The sooner you get help, the better your long-term outlook will be.</p>
